      text. The layout of a web page seen by the user is put together by the web
      browser based on the code in the text file.

      Review Notes Each text editor has its own features like: Syntax
      highlighting Line numbers Make sure you're using a text editor and not a
      word processor. They can add information to files on how to format text
      where as a text editor edits plain text files. When writing HTML, make
      sure to use the extension .html on your file name. An example would be
      spiffy.html. You can open the file in the browser. If you want to see a
      change in the browser that was made in the HTML file, you need to save the
      HTML file and refresh the browser.

      Markup: Text that has a special meaning Every element starts and ends with
      a tag.
      <em>Hi there!</em>
      <em>for practice emphsize</em>
      The first tag <em>is called an opening tag, the one with a slash </em> is
      called a closing tag. HTML tags always start with the lessthan sign and
      end with a greaterthan tag. These are usually referred to as angle
      brackets.

    <h5>about image</h5>
    <p>
      Images significantly enhance the web's appeal, featuring everything from
      cat pictures to maps and advertisements. The img element in HTML, equipped
      with src (source URL) and alt (text description) attributes enable the
      inclusion of these visuals in web pages. The alt attribute is crucial for
      accessibility, describing when images fail to load due to network issues,
      are missing, or when assisting visually impaired users with screen
      readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The img element points the browser to an image's location without
      embedding the file into the HTML document, functioning as an empty element
      with no closing tag. It integrates directly into the text, influencing
      layout based on its size. This setup underscores the importance of
      thoughtfully using images in web design to ensure aesthetic appeal and
      accessibility.
    </p>
    <h5>What about accessibility?</h5>
    <p>
      Alt text is essential for web accessibility, enabling screen readers to
      describe images to users who are blind or have visual impairments, and
      ensuring content is accessible when images cannot load or for those using
      text-based browsers. It also supports users with cognitive disabilities
      and improves SEO by giving search engines context for images.
